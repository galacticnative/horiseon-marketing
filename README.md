# horiseon-marketing
1st challenge
The index.html file was reviewed first. The title was changed to Horiseon Web Marketing, as it captures the summary of what the business offers.

The header section was initially a div that had a class labeled header, which was not necessary as there is usually just one header, so the element was changed to header.

The content section was labeled with a div element, but since it is an actual section of the website, the section element was used instead and a class of content remained. 

The div element with the class online-reputation-management had an ID labeled content but was redundant and removed. 

The next section was also labeled with a div element and was replaced with a section element. 

Each image did not have an alt tag to describe the image, so an alt tag was listed within each img attribute. 

The footer section was labeled with a div element and a class named footer, but footer is an element and so was changed to a footer element.

The style.css page was then corrected to remove incorrect class or section references to the index.html file. 

Some sections of the style sheet were consolidated such as the content class h2's and img's. 

The benefits class h3's and img's were consolidated. 

The benefits class was grouped in the same area of the style sheet and the content class was grouped together to give better flow. 

The style sheet begins with css that applied to the whole webpage and then started with header and footer. After was the class styles and webpage content styles that were more specific to classes. 

Commits to GitHub were pushed at various times throughout the refractor process.
